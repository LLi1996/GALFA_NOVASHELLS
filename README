GALFA_NOVASHELLS

This repo contains scrips written (mainly in Python) for finding nova shells in
the GALFA_HI data set.

The code, however, does not limit itself to finding nova shells. Extraction of
spectra, integrated intensity maps, velocity channel maps, ect., from GALFA_HI
cubes can be easily done when provided with a target and a set of coordinates (
in RA & DEC)
